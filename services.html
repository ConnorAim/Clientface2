                    <p>We understand that organisations often face challenges when key
                        members of their teams are absent due to various reasons, such as
                        parental leave, extended vacations, or unexpected circumstances.

                    <h3>Client listening
                        programmes</h3>
                    <p>Listening to your clients goes beyond simply hearing their words. It involves
                        understanding their perspective, empathising with their situation, and
                        acknowledging their emotions. By actively listening, you can gain valuable
                        insights into their expectations, identify potential issues, and uncover
                        opportunities to provide tailored legal solutions. Client Listening underpins
                        all successful client relationship management programmes and approaches.<br><br>
                        
                        Client needs are constantly changing and expectations of service providers is
                        higher; embedding a client feedback ethos and approach is essential to
                        growing market share and developing deeper, long-term relationships with
                        clients. There is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to managing client
                        relationships; it’s about really getting underneath the skin of the client-
                        knowing the client’s business; its unique commercial drivers, its issues and
                        challenges and anticipating the client’s evolving needs. This can only be
                        achieved if you know how to listen effectively to your clients and how to use
                        client insights to drive forward internal behaviours.<br><br>
                        
                        Whether you have an established client feedback programme that needs
                        re-energising or you are starting from scratch and need to launch a
                        programme, we can help you.</p>

                    <p>We help clients pitch to win more profitable work. Getting onto
                        client panels can be a long-term game. We have many years’

                        from day 1 – we can help you deliver this and seek feedback on
                        the pitching process to help you improve your next pitch.<br><br>

                        services</h3>
                    <p>As budgets tighten, clients are increasingly looking for more value
                        from their suppliers, over and above the provision of core services.
                        Value added services has become a hygiene factor to most client
                        relationships as organisations strive to differentiate from their
                        competitors.<br><br>
                        
                        Delivery of value added services does not have to mean a huge
                        investment – these often already exist within your own business,
                        within HR, IT or within training departments. We believe there are
                        opportunities to share some of the expertise you hold in
                        operational functions to become truly client-facing and to partner
                        with the client to help strengthen and deepen the relationship
